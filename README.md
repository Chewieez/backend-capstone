# Freshie & Zero Sales Rep Portal

This application will serve as a way for Sales Reps and business owners to visualize their current Whole Sale accounts and quickly see the status of each store, each store's location on a map and when each store last ordered. 

Users will also be able to view details about a store such as full street address, contact person, email address, phone number, and last order info.

Users can add a flag to a store as a visual reminder for them to Follow Up with that store.

Users can leave themselves notes on their dashboard. These could be ideas of new stores to contact, ideas for a trip to visit stores or any note they would like to leave that is not specific to one store. 

Users can also leave notes for a specific store on that store's Details page. These can be about how a visit went, when they'd like to reach out to the store next, what things they would like to talk about when they talk with the store next or what have you.
